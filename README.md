# Time-Domain and Frequency-Domain Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of signals in both the time and frequency domains. It aims to provide insights into the characteristics of signals by exploring their representation in both domains. 

## Features

The project includes:

- **Analysis of signals in the time domain:**  Detailed investigation of signal characteristics like amplitude, frequency, and phase over time.
- **Analysis of signals in the frequency domain:**  Transformation of signals into the frequency domain using techniques like Fourier transforms to understand the distribution of frequencies present in the signal.
- **Report Generation:**  Detailed reports summarizing the analysis results, potentially including visualizations and interpretations.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.x

**Installation:**

This project is likely to depend on Python packages. While it's not possible to automatically detect specific packages, it's highly likely that you'll need to install libraries related to signal processing and data visualization. 

**Recommended Libraries:**

- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **SciPy:** For signal processing functions.
- **Matplotlib:** For plotting and visualization.

**Installation using pip:**

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## Usage

**Running the analysis:**

The project likely contains code scripts or notebooks that perform the analysis. 

**Example:**

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.signal as signal
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load signal data
data = np.load('signal_data.npy')

# Perform time-domain analysis
# ...

# Perform frequency-domain analysis
# ...

# Plot and visualize results
# ...
```

**Generating the report:**

The project might contain scripts or notebooks that generate the final report, potentially using libraries like `pandas` and `seaborn`. 

**Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

# Create a DataFrame from the analysis results
df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Generate plots and visualizations using seaborn
# ...

# Create a report using pandas or other reporting tools
# ...
```
